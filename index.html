				<h2>Study at Waterloo</h2>
				<p>Studying at Waterloo is intense, exhausted but meaningful. Remebering the tension before deadline, which let me know how importent it is to schedule a project properly. Amazing ideas are always inspired working with team members and it feels a great sense of achievement after finishing a big work within teams. It is normal that you did not understand what all it says after first reading one assignment or project. After going crazy for a while, I got to learn to search on the website and looking for the documentation.  </p>
