				<div class="title2">Study at <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/" target="_blank">WATERLOO</a></div>
				<p>Studying at Waterloo is intense, exhausted but meaningful. Remebering the tension before deadline, which let me know how important it is to schedule a project properly. Amazing ideas are always inspired working with team members and it feels a great sense of achievement after finishing a big work within teams. It is normal that you did not understand what it says after first reading one assignment or project. After going crazy for a while, I got to solve it independently, searching on the website and looking for the documentation, asking classmates and professor for help lastly. I am currenly learn how to make my own webpage using html/css and javasricpt. I am sure I can go further.  </p>
